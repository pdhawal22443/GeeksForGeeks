Count number of ways to get Odd Sum
Given N pairs of numbers. The task is to count ways to choose exactly one number from each pair such that the sum of those numbers is odd.

Examples:

Input:
N = 2
3 4
1 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can choose 3 from the first pair and 2 from the second pair, and their sum is 5 which is odd.
Also, we can choose 4 from the first pair and 1 from the second pair, and their sum is 5 which is odd.
So the total possible ways will be 2.
