'''
Minimize the maximum difference between adjacent elements in an array
Given a non-decreasing array arr[] and an integer K, the task is to remove K
elements from the array such that maximum difference between adjacent element is minimum.
Note: K < N â€“ 2

Examples:
Input: arr[] = {3, 7, 8, 10, 14}, K = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
After removing elements A[0] and A[4],
The maximum difference between adjacent elements is minimum.
After removing elements, the remaining array is [7, 8, 10]

Input: arr[] = [12, 16, 22, 31, 31, 38], K = 3
Output: 6
Explanation:
After removing elements A[3], A[4] and A[5],
The maximum difference between adjacent elements is minimum.
After removing elements, the remaining array is [12, 16, 22]

Idea is to remove
